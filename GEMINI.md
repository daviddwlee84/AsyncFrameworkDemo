# Gemini Code Assistant Context

## Project Overview

This project is a demonstration of an asynchronous framework, as described in the `README.md` file. The goal is to showcase a system where a client interacts with a GraphQL endpoint, which then triggers asynchronous workers via PostgreSQL triggers and notifications. These workers then interact with a third-party API.

The project is in its early stages and the `main.py` file is currently a placeholder.

### Key Technologies

*   **Python:** The backend is written in Python.
*   **PostgreSQL:** Used as the database, with triggers and `pg_notify` for asynchronous communication.
*   **GraphQL:** The API for client interaction.
*   **Third-Party API:** The asynchronous workers will interact with an external API.

## Building and Running

There are no explicit instructions for building or running the project yet.

**TODO:** Add build and run commands once they are defined.

## Development Conventions

There are no explicit development conventions defined yet.
